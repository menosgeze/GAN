# GAN
Exploratory Code to learn Generative Adversary Networks

## sample_1_generating_digits
This was motivated from the book:
Generative Adversarial Networks - Cookbook by Josh Kalin.

I had to rewrite many components because I did not create a docker container, since this is my first time writing a GAN and I did not want to obscure the result with technicalities that don't belong to the subject.

Also, I had to modify many lines of code since the keras and tensorflow packages installed in my personal computer are not the same as that suggested in the book. This was a good exercise of debugging and learning functionalities that are deprecated in this libraries.

As of this commit the versions using are:

tensorflow = '2.13.0'
keras = '2.13.1'
